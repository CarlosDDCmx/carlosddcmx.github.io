As any field, programming has its own collection of definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts. Understanding these fundamental terms is essential for anyone learning or working in programming. Here will be stored a glossary with some of the most common concetps and terms realted to programming:

- **Algorithm**: A precise step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a computation.
- **Assembler**: A computer program that translates low-level assembly language into machine-readable binary code that can be directly executed by a computer's processor.
- **Automation**: The use of technology, such as software or machinery, to perform tasks with minimal human intervention, increasing efficiency and reducing the potential for human error.
- **Back-end (BE)**: The part of a software application that handles the server-side logic, data processing, and integration with other systems, often hidden from the user.
- **Container**: A standardized unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies, allowing an application to run reliably and consistently across different computing environments.
- **Command Line**: A text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system, allowing users to execute commands, run scripts, and manage files and directories.
- **Compiler:**: A computer program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine-readable instructions.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: A software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, and automated builds, tests, and deployments are performed to ensure the software is always in a releasable state.
- **Data Structures**: Ways of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory.
- **Database**: A structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of information, typically using a database management system (DBMS).
- **Debugging**: The process of identifying and resolving errors or defects in computer software or hardware to ensure it functions as intended.
- **Front-end (FE)**: The part of a software application that interacts directly with the user, focusing on the user interface, user experience, and client-side functionality.
- **Full-stack (FS)**: A developer who is proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, capable of working on the entire software stack.
- **Interpreter**: A computer program that executes instructions written in a high-level programming language by translating and running them one by one, rather than compiling the entire program at once.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Operating System (OS)**: The low-level software that manages a computer's hardware resources and provides a platform for running application software.
- **Pipeline**: A series of automated steps or stages that transform source code into a deployable software product, often including tasks such as building, testing, and releasing the application.
- **Programming Languages**: Formal languages used to write computer programs.
- **Recursion**: A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar instances of the same problem.
- **Repository**: A central location where code, documentation, or other project-related files are stored and managed, typically using a version control system like Git.
- **Software Development Lifecycle**: The process of developing, testing, and maintaining software.
- **Unit Test**: A type of software test that verifies the correctness of a specific, isolated part of a program, often a single function or module, to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Version Control:**: A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project and manage its evolution.
